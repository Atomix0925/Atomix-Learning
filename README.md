ðŸŽ® Welcome to Atomix's Game Site! ðŸŽ®

Hey, Iâ€™m Atomix â€” and this is my school game website!

It might not be the fanciest site out there, but trust me, it packs a punch. ðŸ’¥
While most game sites just copy and paste random games without checking if they even work... I donâ€™t roll like that.

Yeah, I paste games too â€” but I test every single one to make sure it actually works before I add it. No broken buttons or blank screens here.

The site goes live when school starts â€” stay tuned!
